## Who We Are

We are two engineers with expertise in Generative AI and Flutter UI development who understand the importance of data privacy and security in today's digital world. Born from our own concerns about cloud-based storage systems that automatically sync and store personal data with tech giants, Second Brain was created as an alternative that puts you in control of your information.

## Our Mission

Second Brain aims to provide a secure, private, and intelligent solution for managing your sensitive information entirely on your device. We believe your personal data should remain personal â€“ accessible to you whenever needed, but never exposed to unnecessary risks.

## Why Second Brain?

Unlike mainstream cloud services, Second Brain stores everything locally on your device. Your notes, passwords, events, and documents never leave your phone unless you explicitly choose to export them. Our AI-powered search helps you find what you need quickly without compromising on security.

## Open Source

Second Brain is an open source project. We believe in transparency and community collaboration. Anyone can view our code and help make Second Brain better!

Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kvk0699/second_brain_app) to see our code, report issues, or suggest improvements.
